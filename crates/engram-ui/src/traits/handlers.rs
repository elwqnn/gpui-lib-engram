//! Shared type aliases for component event handlers.
//!
//! Every interactive component in engram stores its callbacks as
//! `Rc<dyn Fn(...) + 'static>`. Before this module existed, each component
//! re-declared the same type alias (`ClickHandler`, `DismissHandler`,
//! `MenuClickHandler`, …) with slightly different names — a real maintenance
//! trap when the signature needs to change. Keeping the aliases here means:
//!
//! - there's **one** place to update the handler signature,
//! - component code reads uniformly (`ClickHandler` means the same thing
//!   everywhere),
//! - new components can pick an existing alias instead of minting a new one.
//!
//! All handlers use `Rc` rather than `Box` so that a single handler can be
//! cloned into multiple closures (e.g. `on_click` + `on_key_down`) within a
//! single render pass.
//!
//! If you need a handler shape that isn't represented here, add it — don't
//! re-declare a local alias.

/// keyboard (Escape) paths, so there's no single meaningful event.

/// boolean payload is `true` when the cursor enters and `false` when it

/// secondary (right-click) actions where a richer event payload than
