//! Story-local asset bundle + fallback composition with engram-ui's [`Assets`].
//!
//! The story gallery doubles as a live demo of [`Icon::from_path`]. To make
//! that demo honest, the story needs at least one SVG that is *not* part of
//! engram's embedded set - otherwise `Icon::from_path` would trivially
//! resolve against engram's bundle and the consumer-side wiring would stay
//! invisible.
//!
//! [`StoryAssets`] embeds story-local SVGs under `demo/`. [`ComposedAssets`]
//! is the [`AssetSource`] actually handed to `application().with_assets(...)`;
//! it tries the story bundle first and falls back to engram-ui's [`Assets`],
//! mirroring the pattern a downstream consumer would use to layer their own
//! assets on top of the library defaults.
