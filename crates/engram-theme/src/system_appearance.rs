//! Bridge between the OS light/dark appearance and engram's active theme.
//!
//! When enabled, this module subscribes to GPUI's window appearance observer
//! and calls [`activate_theme`] with either the dark or the light theme name
//! whenever the system flips. This keeps apps that follow the OS scheme in
//! sync without each call site wiring its own observer.
