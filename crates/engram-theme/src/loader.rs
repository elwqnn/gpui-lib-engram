//! JSON theme loading.
//!
//! A [`ThemeContent`] is the on-disk representation of a theme: a name, an
//! appearance hint, and a partial [`ThemeColorsRefinement`]. The appearance
//! field decides which built-in base theme (`default_dark` or `default_light`)
//! the refinement is layered on top of, so user themes can be as sparse as
//! they like - overriding a single accent color is a valid theme.
//!
//! The canonical entry point is [`Theme::from_json_bytes`], used both by the
//! built-in theme assets and by [`hot_reload`](crate::hot_reload) when it
//! spots a file change.
